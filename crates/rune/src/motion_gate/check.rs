//! Frame-by-frame motion checks over a run's element tree.
//!
//! [`Recording::sample`] takes every element's presented rect, visible part and opacity each
//! frame of a run on the virtual clock; [`check`] reads them back and lists what a person would
//! see go wrong: things that appear or vanish with no transition, jump in one frame, lurch,
//! turn back, overshoot, flicker or never settle. Elements are tracked by their tree path, so a
//! keyed row keeps its identity however the rows around it change.
//!
//! Nothing here knows about the app: thresholds live in [`RULES`], one row per finding kind.
//! [`super::Run`] drives a runtime and records it; [`super::gate`] runs and reports the cells.
