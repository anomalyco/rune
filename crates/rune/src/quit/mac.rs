//! AppKit asks the app delegate `applicationShouldTerminate:` before every quit: ⌘Q, the Dock's
//! Quit, logout, restart and shutdown. winit's delegate doesn't implement it, so Rune adds the
//! method to the delegate's class once (as `platform::reopen` does for reopening). It marks the
//! app quitting and lets the quit go ahead; `applicationWillTerminate:` follows at once, where
//! winit ends the loop and `Windows::exiting` runs every window's `App::on_quit`, then its
//! `on_close`.
