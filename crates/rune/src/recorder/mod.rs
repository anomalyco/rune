//! Audio recording: a cheap, cloneable [`Recorder`] handle that records the microphone to a
//! file, with elapsed time and a smoothed input level to draw.
//!
//! In a window on macOS, AVAudioRecorder records on its own thread (AAC or WAV, metering built
//! in) and publishes the level 30 times a second while recording. Elsewhere starting fails with
//! a clear state.
//!
//! Headless runs (no window event loop yet, as with `Player`) never open a device: recorders
//! hear a [`FakeMicrophone`], elapsed time follows the virtual clock of the runtime stepping
//! on the thread that started them, levels come from the fake samples in 10 ms blocks (so they
//! don't depend on the frame rate), and `stop` writes a real WAV.
