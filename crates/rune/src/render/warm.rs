//! `warm_gpu` away from macOS: a GPU device and Rune's renderer made on a thread ahead of a
//! surface that may show soon, and the slot the next surface takes them from (`Gpu::for_surface`).
//! Unclaimed, they go after `LINGER`, so an app that warms on a hint and then shows nothing
//! holds no device for long. A hidden overlay that gives its surface back parks its device and
//! renderer here too (`park`), for `PARKED` rather than `LINGER`: an overlay shown for each
//! dictation takes the same device every time instead of making one per show (hex#1268).
