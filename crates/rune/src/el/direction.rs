//! Layout direction: `El::dir` lays a subtree out right to left (or left to right inside one
//! that is), as HTML's `dir` attribute does, and `El::mirror_in_rtl` flips a directional icon.
//!
//! Layout runs left to right; a right-to-left element then mirrors where its children sit inside
//! it, so a row's first child is at its right, start and end alignment swap, and an absolute
//! child's left inset is its right. Its own padding, border sides, corner radii, soft clip
//! edges and linear gradients swap left and right with it, as CSS's logical `start` and `end`
//! resolve: in this model `left` means start (`El::unmirrored` keeps an element physical).
//! An `El::anchored` overlay's `Left` and `Right` sides and a `Top` or `Bottom` overlay's
//! `Start` and `End` alignment swap too. Shadows, `El::offset` and other visual transforms
//! stay physical, as CSS's do. Text lays out with a right-to-left paragraph
//! direction (bidi base level), so its `Start` alignment is its right edge.
//!
//! Each element's direction resolves as one step down the tree ([`step`]), from its parent's
//! [`Flow`] and its own [`DirEvent`]. Nothing is mirrored in a window that sets no
//! right-to-left direction: layout reads one small enum per element.
