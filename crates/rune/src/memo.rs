//! [`memo`]: reuse a subtree whose inputs haven't changed instead of building it again.
//!
//! A view runs top to bottom every commit, so a transcript of 500 messages builds 500 messages
//! every frame its counter ticks. Wrapping each in `memo(id, version, || ...)` builds a message
//! once per version: later commits get the element the first build returned, without calling
//! the closure. Children reach the element tree only when the element mounts, so the rows a
//! `virtualize` list leaves offscreen cost a lookup each and nothing else.
//!
//! What a reused subtree keeps, and what invalidates it:
//!
//! - **Identity.** A reused subtree is the same elements under the same key paths, so node ids,
//!   hover and press, focus, scroll offsets and running springs carry on exactly as if it had
//!   been built again. The inspector, `--tree`, `Runtime::elements` and accessibility read the
//!   element tree after the subtree is in it, and see it like any other.
//! - **Handlers** in the subtree are the ones its build made. They see what they captured then,
//!   so anything a handler captures that can change must be part of `version`. Handlers that
//!   only send a message or an id never go stale. A row's position is one of those things: a
//!   handler in a list row should capture the row's id, never its index, which shifts when
//!   rows are inserted or removed above it while the memo keeps the old handler.
//! - **Live values and pixels** stay bound: a `Live`, `LiveText` or `Pixels` is a shared handle,
//!   so a reused subtree shows its newest value or image without a rebuild.
//! - **Environment.** The window's dark mode, scale, reduced-motion preference, system accent
//!   (`Cx::accent`, `Cx::focus_color`) and blend mode (`theme::blends_srgb`, which theme
//!   colours resolve by) are part of every version, so changing any of them builds
//!   again. App state the closure reads (a theme, a locale, a selection) must be part of
//!   `version`. For a text field that's the
//!   `TextEdit` itself, which hashes its text, selection, composition and focus.
//! - **`Cx` reads.** `Cx::layout`, `Cx::layout_with`, `Cx::layout_size`, `Cx::window_layout`,
//!   `Cx::window_layout_with` and `Cx::caret` called inside the closure are recorded with
//!   what they returned. A reuse counts them as read
//!   again, so the view still re-runs when they move, and builds again when one returns
//!   something else. They needn't be in `version`.
//! - **Hot reload** (`rune/hot`) drops every cached subtree, so new code always builds.
//! - **Virtual rows** that scroll out keep their cached subtree as long as the view still
//!   creates them (virtualized rows always are); scrolling back in mounts it again without a
//!   build. A memo the view stops creating is dropped once the commit that stopped creating it
//!   applies (a commit may build its view more than once). Rows `El::virtual_rows` builds count
//!   as part of the view build, so a memo in one is kept while its row stays in the mounted
//!   window and dropped once the row leaves it.
//!
//! The id names the subtree within the window, so it must be unique among the memos of one
//! view build (a message id, say). A memo inside another's closure is named within it, so
//! `memo("b0", ..)` inside each message's memo doesn't collide. A second memo with an id
//! already used in the same build just builds, uncached.
//!
//! Layout isn't stored: a reused subtree still lays out each commit it is mounted, but Taffy
//! keeps each unchanged node's measured size, so this is cheap while width and constraints hold.
