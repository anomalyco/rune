//! Paint-time pixel snapping (`El::pixel_snap`). Layout stays fractional; only where a box's
//! fill, border and clips land on the device grid changes, so a 1.1 pt gap at 2× still draws
//! hard edges.
//!
//! Edges snap, not origin plus size: each of a box's four edges rounds to the nearest device
//! pixel, so two boxes that share an edge round it the same way and meet with no seam or
//! overlap. A box at least half a pixel across keeps at least one pixel; a thinner one keeps
//! its exact edges on that axis rather than vanish.
//!
//! Motion: a moving box's edges are corrected toward the rounding of where it comes to rest
//! (every track at its target), not of where it is, so it glides at full sub-pixel precision
//! with no stepping. When the rest changes, each edge eases from the correction it drew with
//! at that moment to the new rest's, in proportion to how far it has left to travel, so a
//! motion starts where the box was and its last frame is the snapped resting rect: no jump at
//! either end. Boxes that move together share their progress, so a child keeps its place
//! against its parent's edges as both glide. Translations that are not animation tracks
//! (scroll offsets, sticky shifts, rows growing above) move a whole subtree together: they snap
//! as one rounded translation, so the rows of a scrolling list stay crisp and keep their
//! spacing every frame. A scaled subtree doesn't snap while the scale moves its edges by a
//! pixel or more; over the last pixel of a scale settling at 1 the snap fades in, so it lands
//! without a jump either. Turned subtrees don't snap.
//!
//! Scaled layers: a node with its own scale (a zoomed canvas, a pressed button) heads a layer,
//! and its subtree snaps against the grid where the scale puts it once the layer holds still.
//! While the layer moves (a zoom, a pinch, a spring), its content draws at its exact sub-pixel
//! edges, except that each box lets go of its resting correction over the first pixel that box
//! moves, so content at the pivot stays put. Once the layer holds still the correction to the
//! grid eases in over [`SETTLE`], so a zoom ends with no pop. Nothing depends on where a box
//! sits against the pivot: whether the layer moves is how far it moves points of the window,
//! and how near its scale is to 1 is one value for the whole layer, how far the scale moves the
//! layer's edges. Two layers that draw a point in the same place snap it alike, wherever each
//! is anchored, except while a scale is within a pixel of 1, where each lands on the unscaled
//! grid.
//!
//! Centring: a box whose resting edges sit centred in its parent's on an axis keeps equal
//! whole-pixel gaps to its parent's resting rounding there, and gives up to a pixel of its size
//! for it, as a 16 pt knob in a 20 pt track at 1.25× can't sit 2.5 px from each edge on whole
//! pixels. The gap rounds by size, not position, so the same control draws alike wherever it
//! sits. It is decided at rest, so a glide eases into and out of it.
