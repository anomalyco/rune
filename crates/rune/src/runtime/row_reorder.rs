//! Rows a commit reorders in a growth stack, and so in a virtual list, slide from where they
//! were drawn into their new places. A growth stack owns its rows' vertical places and lays them
//! out at once, so without this a reordered row would jump there in one frame.
//!
//! Only a change of order counts. The rows a stack held before and after the commit are placed
//! twice, in their old order and in their new one, each at its presented height, and a row slides
//! by the difference. Rows that kept their order relative to each other (the old places that
//! still increase) place the same unless a moved row passed them, which moves them by its
//! height. Rows that came or went, window shifts, estimate corrections and height changes move
//! no row here: growth carries those, as it does a row inserted or removed above another.
