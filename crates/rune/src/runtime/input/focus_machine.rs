//! The focus machine: which element has keyboard focus, how focus shows, and where Tab starts
//! while nothing has it. `step` decides; `Runtime::set_focus` and the input routes feed it and
//! carry out what it returns (the IME, links and the inputs' own focus flags follow a move).
//!
//! The pieces it keeps apart, as a browser does:
//! - [`Focus`]: nothing focused, or one element. Only an element the pointer lit as a
//!   `focus_highlight` row is `hovered`, and only while nothing is focused is there a starting
//!   point for Tab (`from`) or a focus a press just took away (`blurred`).
//! - [`Modality`]: whether focus shows (CSS `:focus-visible`'s heuristic). It outlives a blur,
//!   so focus a closing modal hands back shows as it did.
//! - [`TypeSelect`]: a list's typed prefix, which a pause ends.
