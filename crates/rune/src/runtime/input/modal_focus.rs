//! The modal focus machine: the open modals, innermost last, each holding where focus returns
//! when it closes, as a web dialog stack does (`dialog-machine.ts` in OpenCode's UI: an open
//! entry's `focus` is where focus was before it opened, and only the top layer traps focus and
//! hands it back). `step` decides; `Runtime::sync_modals` feeds it what the commit shows and
//! carries out its effects. A menu or a select's listbox the pointer opened hands focus back
//! without a ring, as Desktop's menu machine does (`ui/src/navigation/menu/machine.ts`,
//! `selectMenuRestoreTriggerWithoutRing`): keys used inside it don't make its trigger ring.
