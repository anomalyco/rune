//! went down, whether it's still inside its element or a scroll cancelled it, whether it
//! travelled past the click slop, whether it's the second of a double press, an armed OS drag,
//! the link it began on),
//! so none of it outlives the release. Between presses only the first click of a possible
//! double press is kept. The input routes in `pointer.rs`, `gesture.rs`, `secondary.rs` and
