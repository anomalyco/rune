//! Loops keep the app's time. Animation time drops most of what a covered, hidden, idle or
//! suspended window spends, so motion never teleports. A periodic loop is a rhythm, though,
//! often one an app keys to its own clock with `LoopSpec::delay`, and two loops started at
//! different times fell out of step by whatever animation time dropped between their starts:
//! a shimmer's window and the bright copy that slides back inside it stopped cancelling, and
//! the copy sat off its label. Every periodic loop gets the time animation time dropped
//! before any commit can start another, and a frame's commits start loops at the frame's
//! presented time, so loops whose delays come from the app clock stay in step however late
//! each mounts.
