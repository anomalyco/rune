//! Reading an element's laid-out rect: `Cx::layout` (or only what a view computes from it,
//! `Cx::layout_with` and `Cx::layout_size`) for views, `El::on_layout` for handlers, and
//! `El::on_screen_layout` for handlers in global screen points (the rect plus the window origin
//! its host reports through `Runtime::set_window_origin`).
//!
//! A `layout_with` read keeps its function, and re-runs its view only when the function gives
//! the new rect something other than it gave the old one, so a size read doesn't re-run when
//! the element only moves, and a "scrolled past the top" flag only when it flips.
//!
//! All of them see where layout puts an element (window points, after scrolling), never a frame of
//! its spring, so they don't re-run through animations. A view reading something its own
//! output resizes (its own size, say) can feed back into itself; that settles instead of
//! looping:
//! - Inside a commit, the view re-runs while what it read moved, at most [`PASSES`] more times.
//!   The values it is given next are then the final layout's, so nothing re-runs by itself.
//! - Between commits, only scrolling moves a laid-out rect, which re-runs readers next frame.
//! - Commits caused only by layout reads or `on_layout`, with no scroll moving, count up; past
//!   [`ECHOES`] in a row, reads and `on_layout` stop causing commits until anything else
//!   commits or a scroll moves. Reads get the current rects at the next commit.
//!
//! What a view is given for each key stays what its reads last saw until a read of the key
//! moves or a commit runs the view again, so movement below a read's threshold adds up until
//! it counts.
