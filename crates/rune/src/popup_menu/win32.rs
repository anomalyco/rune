//! Win32 pop-up menus. `TrackPopupMenuEx` runs its own modal loop until the menu closes. Run
//! inside a winit handler, that loop would hold every Rune frame: winit buffers the events it
//! dispatches while its handler is busy. So the menu opens from a message posted to the window,
//! which winit's loop dispatches after the handler returns. While the menu tracks, its loop
//! hands the window's paints and wakes to winit as usual, so Rune keeps drawing. winit's own
//! idle turn (`AboutToWait`, resting timers) runs only between its message loops, so a timer
//! asks for that turn while the menu tracks (`start`).
//!
//! The menu drops down below an element anchor and opens with its top-left corner at a point,
//! as Windows menus do. A plain Win32 menu can't put an item under the pointer or take a
//! minimum width, so `Show::positioned` and `Show::min_width` don't apply. Keyboard navigation
//! (arrows, Enter, Esc, first letters, submenus), screen-edge flipping and dismissal by a click
//! outside are the system's. Menus are light or dark as the window's content is (`scheme`).
