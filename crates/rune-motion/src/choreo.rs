//! Choreography: stagger, cue-based sequences and phase cycling, run by the render thread.
//!
//! Beats start on *events*, not on summed durations: "when that one arrives", "when it settles",
//! "not before 0.3 s". A spring's physical tail is not its choreographic span (psychopomp
//! `DSL.md`: `settle_in` is ready after 500 ms while its spring is still settling). Cue times
//! that are known in advance (a start, a logical arrival) are scheduled exactly through the
//! store's delays, so a sequence lands on the same frames at any frame rate.
